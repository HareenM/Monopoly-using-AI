# Monopoly-using-AI
Mini Project (AY: 2021-2022)

Project Name: Monopoly using AI

Description:
Monopoly using AI is an exciting and immersive video game project developed using Tkinter and Python. This mini-project aims to recreate the classic board game of Monopoly in a digital format, incorporating artificial intelligence to enhance the gameplay experience. Players can engage in strategic property trading, financial management, and decision-making while competing against intelligent computer opponents or other human players.

Key Features:

Interactive Game Board: Create a visually appealing game board interface that replicates the iconic Monopoly board, complete with properties, cards, and other game elements.
Player Controls: Implement user-friendly controls to allow players to roll dice, move their tokens across the board, purchase properties, pay rent, and make strategic decisions.
AI Opponents: Develop intelligent computer opponents with varying levels of difficulty, capable of making informed decisions regarding property purchases, rent negotiations, and financial management.
Chance and Community Chest Cards: Incorporate the randomness of the game through Chance and Community Chest cards, triggering events, rewards, penalties, or opportunities for players.
Financial Management: Implement a virtual banking system to manage players' finances, including tracking cash balances, property ownership, mortgages, and transactions.
Game Progression: Track and display the game progression, including current player turn, properties owned, available funds, and other relevant game statistics.
Game Rules and Instructions: Provide clear instructions and rules of the game, accessible within the game interface, to guide players throughout the gameplay.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
User Interface: Tkinter
Artificial Intelligence: Algorithms for decision-making and opponent behavior (optional)
Note: The above technologies are suggestions, and you may choose alternative technologies based on your project requirements and familiarity.
